    <h2>About Elephants</h2>
   <section > 
    
    <p id="ele">Elephants are the largest living land animals. 
        Three living species are currently recognised: 
        the African bush elephant, 
        the African forest elephant, 
        and the Asian elephant.
        Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin.
         The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. 
         Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. 
         The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
          African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>

     <p>  
        African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
         One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade,
          as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. 
          Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. 
          Elephants are used as working animals in Asia.
